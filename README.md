<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
For my ITIS 4166 class (Network-based App Development), my professor wants us to build an e-commerce website. So I built a luxury cheese marketplace for cheese connoisseurs
so I could control 1 percent of the market and get VC funding. Jokes aside, I pretty much went straight into making it from the beginning of the semester. I learned a lot about 
how express.js works and used its templating engine `ejs` for routing the HTML. Then I imported Tailwind CSS CDN and stylized everything to try and make it look like a 
premium place to bid and trade cheeses.

### Breakdown 
* I used Model View Controller (MVC) architecture which made it easy to structure the project while separating the inner components and functionality
  into three interconnected parts.
![MVC Diagram](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c025884c-a502-4bf6-a3d6-e4198db2829d/da436475-c6ba-4fac-8dbb-997a4e355649/Untitled.png)
* Used express built-in middleware `express.static()` to serve my static files & parse request body (JSON) `express.urlencoded({})`. Most of the files are images that I made such as the branding and others are art generated by Midjourney.
* Middleware libraries that I've used are: 
  * ![UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) - Used to generate different IDs for each object. Useful for preventing CSRF attacks.
  * ![Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) - Logs request (HTTP) and its associated endpoints.
  * ![Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) - Easily launch the project to a dev environment and enable hot-reload refresh on local change saved.
  * ![Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) - Enables the ability to upload files (specifically with image file extensions). All uploads are stored in my project directory (local).
  * ![express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) - Allow for user authorization and authentication. Sessions are stored in the database and compared with cookies. Sessions are cleared every time we exit the project instance.
  * ![express-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-validator) - Sanitizes and validates form data.
  * ![express-rate-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit) - Limits repeated authentication requests to protect against network-based guessing attacks.
* General libraries used:
  * ![bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) - Hashing library used to hash passwords before storing them into MongoDB.
  * ![connect-mongo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-mongo) - Allowed storing a user session `express-session` into the Mongo database.
  * ![connect-flash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-flash) - Used for flash messages (displaying warnings or success) to provide user feedback.
* My models only contain the abstraction written with `Mongoose`. Since Mongo doesn't do relational databases, I cannot use foreign keys but I can still explicitly reference other documents by having references.
  * For example my `offerSchema` for the offer model holds reference to User & Cheese model.
* My controllers contain callback functions for my routes to use. This is where I defined what the route is expected to do such as POST data into my database or make a GET request to display `HTML` with data (depends). For my routes, I can also attach configured middlewares to my route as args to perform for example form validation or authorize whether the user is allowed to visit the page.
* Any `HTML` goes into  `/views/`. To avoid redundancy, I made reusable components such as a navbar or footer which goes to `/views/partials/`.
* My project is not perfect though, it contains some bugs and are missing small details so if you discover anything, please make an issue.
